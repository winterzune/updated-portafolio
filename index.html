            <p>All my life I have been completly obssesed with computers,so in a way it's surprising it took me this long to finally formally study this field. Fresh outta school I went to Univerty and became a lawyer, but I never went for an engeneering degree, because for some reason, studying something that I love so much felt like cheating.</p>
      
            <p>My techy begining started innocently browsing the web, starting with forums back on the begining of the 2000's, when computers were mostly big chunks of beige or gray. From there I learned some html in school, and continued on learning different things here and there, eventually (like I'm sure it happens to most of us in this class), I unoficially became the it guy for my family...at school...at work...etc.</p> <p>Recently, and most of what led me to truly want to learn a computer language, was when I started playing and tinkering with projects done on Raspberry Pi's and Arduinos. This whole time I've been researching the different things you can build and copying projects other people have created, now I truly want to start creating my own projects and sharing it with other hobbyist like me.</p>
      
            <p>Few other hobbies I've got outside of tech happen to be reading, snowboarding, writing, listening to music and watching a few great shows like Doctor Who and Suits.</p>
